# DS3 Hackathon 2023
## About the hackathon
The hackathon is a yearly event hosted by the University of Toronto's Data Science & Statistics Society (DS3). Over 7 days, participants were asked to form teams, given datasets concerning 3 different topics (celestial body prediction, heart disease prediction, traffic signs prediction), and asked to train classification algorithms, use these algorithms to make predictions, and upload these predictions to a Kaggle competition where the predictions would be judged using the accuracy score metric. 
## What this repository contains
This repository contains the work I did individually during the 2023 iteration of the hackathon. Using previously acquired knowledge of popular classification algorithms including decision trees, bagging, random forests, and extreme gradient boosting, I was able to produce predictions that scored among the top accuracy scores of the competition for 2 out of the 3 datasets (celestial body prediction and heart disease prediction) that were given to the teams. The work done to obtain these predictions is included in the subdirectories ``celestial`` and ``heart``, where the data, the .Rmd file containing the code that I wrote, and the PDF file produced after knitting the .Rmd file are kept.
